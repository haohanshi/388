First Berlusconi during his first and second term was distracted in his governing by the leftist/communist dominated Justice arm of the government that acts both as prosecution and judge. This was so oppressive to the point that Berlusconi was busy to pass laws to defend himself from criminal charges. Second the only person to defeat Berlusconi at the ballot box was Romani. Romani is the prime minister that dragged Italy in the EU at a high price. After joining the euro prices in Italy practically doubled. Also Romani raised taxes trying desperately to stay within the 3% limit in deficit imposed by the EU. Needless to say the second time he ran against Berlusconi he lost. Berlusconi term came to an end not because he had lost confidence in the parliament but because he was forced out by the EU and Merkel via the Italian president Napolitano who chose Monti as the prime minister. Monti was never voted on by the people. Monti raised taxes, took care of the banks, and eventually was replaced by Renzi who had was elected leader of the PD party but has never won any national political race. Renzi continues as prime minister selected not by the people but by Napolitano and the EU. This sounds like a mess and it is. Copy any Italian thing that you like but never, ever their politics or political system or judicial system.

The reality however is that Obama's winning coalition was based on an explicit recognition of the power of diversity which twice propelled him to victory and with a majority of the vote on both occasions.

It isn't the oppressed and marginalized who do it...Let's see. Democrats won the popular vote, but failed to motivate enough liberals and centrists to the polls in a handful of swing states. Though most of those unswayed or unmotivated voters are whites who helped elect Obama twice, the conclusion is that it's Latinxs and Black people who are the problem, though only 4% of all votes were votes for Trump from those groups--23% of Latinxs and 8% of Black people, as opposed to 58% of white voters for Trump. There was no central motivating message in the Clinton campaign for any voters, the kind of messages that are crucial to winning presidential elections. There was no liberal mirror-image equivalent of \"Build that wall!\" But yeah, the Democrats are gonna go with blaming this loss on the Black people and Latinxs. And it won't be enough to have two parties tripping over themselves to appease that straight able-bodied WASP male middle-upper middle demographic (Gee, there's something new and novel) because that demo won't be appeased unless everyone else is getting the shaft, or so the thinking goes. It's thinking that's offensive to every demographic, and tragic for most. But, Democrat leaders think, why not? The Democrats always figure they can do anything they want to the marginalized, and still have their votes. This country has two very broken and very cynical major political parties."]
