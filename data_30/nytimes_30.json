["A message to Trump and Pence: Art has always been a hotbed of uncomfortable ideas and political disobedience. There is no such thing as a safe art space. Our tradition of using drama as an expression of defiance and call for change goes back farther than the establishment of this country, all the way back to the dawn of Western civilization, to Greek theater. Go read Lysistrata and inform yourself instead of condemning free speech. You are not anointed king, and you have no right to expect a \"reign\" free of criticism, especially from the arts. That's the way it has always been, and that's the way it will always be.

Though most of those unswayed or unmotivated voters are whites who helped elect Obama twice, the conclusion is that it's Latinxs and Black people who are the problem, though only 4% of all votes were votes for Trump from those groups--23% of Latinxs and 8% of Black people, as opposed to 58% of white voters for Trump. There was no central motivating message in the Clinton campaign for any voters, the kind of messages that are crucial to winning presidential elections. There was no liberal mirror-image equivalent of \"Build that wall!\" But yeah, the Democrats are gonna go with blaming this loss on the Black people and Latinxs. And it won't be enough to have two parties tripping over themselves to appease that straight able-bodied WASP male middle-upper middle demographic (Gee, there's something new and novel) because that demo won't be appeased unless everyone else is getting the shaft, or so the thinking goes.
