So this world is completely different world than the ones in Harry Potter. You cant really compare the two times with each other where Voldemort was killing everyone and leashibg darkness all over where the bad character we see is a less scary however powerful and he has the basic idea Voldemort had. \n\nplus rhis movie didnt have books like harry potter. it was just about beasts, no characters in the book originally. so it's understandable that it felt characters lacked dept. but still they werent horrible. i could understand the love happening between them. especially muggle witch thing. \n\nand oh my god wizarding world of other countries, all the rules and different things just made me super super excited. you clearly are forgetting few important details.\n\nplease dont review the franchise again maybe if u didnt like it that much.", "I completely agree with the review.

However, unemployment figures are low in the US and there is talk of a shortage of labor in e.g. the construction sector. This points to wage increase and thus price level rises in the near to mid future. All of this does not pose immediate threats to inflation but the Fed most likely will start to slowly abandon its low interest rate policy to keep inflation expectations in check. Higher interest rates are also necessary to attract foreign investors and borrowers to the US in order to finance Mr Trump's infrastructure spending. So in the medium term I would assume a spike in interest rates and also in inflation (from a rather low base right now). This would also put upward pressure on the US Dollar which already can be seen. If Mr Trump is, in addition to that, pursuing a more protectionist trade policy, then both domestic prices as well as currency value of the US Dollar vis-a-vis the Euro and the Renminbi will increase. US i.e. the US loses competitiveness. Americans will also find that credit financing for e.g. houses will become more expensive. This will then act as a break on consumption and work against the demand impulse from government spending. In the longer term, both effects might cancel each other out and the US economy will have higher price levels but not necessarily more employment. Regardless of that, the competitive position as regards the US Dollar will be weaker unless the ECB and other central banks start to increase their interest rates as well.

The recent brexit referendum, Tory majority in the UK parliament and now trump all point to a vast part of society who are anti establishment whether that is the Congress/Senate in the US or the UK and EU.  I have found that freedom of speech has been eroded so that there was no debate anymore.  The classic example here in the UK was to mention concerns about immigration and you were called racist. The fact that some of those people talking about and objecting to immigration were black or of immigrant families or religious minorities seemed to have escaped the media. The same has happened across the western world where freedom of speech has been hijacked by political correctness or fear of offending a person, race or religion. If we get back to the concept of freedom of speech without the shouting of everyone down, then this situation will resolve itself. \n\nHowever watching TV recently the corbyn version of labour and the SNP feel they have to shout everyone down so that is automatically going to isolate voters. Love or hate Farage or Putin they seem to understand the ordinary person better than our current leaders and that is why nationalism appears to be returning.\n\nIt is easily fixable. However it take political leadership and courage. Not qualities I am seeing much these days.", "How dare people lament the loss of community in the face of waves of immigration.

It is an authoritarian creed similar to National Socialism, another execrable ideology of the left.", "Right when the world needs to come together to combat our divisiveness, right at this opportune time, the collective consciousness of powerful countries is deciding to take a backward step. At the end of this de-globalization journey, what will become apparent though is how this error in evolution will hurt many generations to come. When the rogue nationalistic voices eventually fade, it would be too late to redeem ourselves as a species.", "It's the time for progressives to modernise their policies and take a moderate stand on economical and security issues to bring down to these ultra-nationalist morons.", "Who can truly say they are 100% British?

They should be able to live anywhere.", "People aren't integrating into the society when they immigrate, and there's no possibility of civic nationalism unless everyone is on the same page in terms of values, desires, etc. Instead of a unified multiethnic identity, we have numerous ethnic communities existing separately, with different, potentially conflicting cultures and value systems, with each group refusing to adapt to the other. This is an unstable situation and it's understandable that nationalism is on the rise", "And why do you think that is? Globalization is a fancy word for worldwide socialism. The bolstering of lesser economies at the expense of more developed nations - all in the name of \"free trade\", capitalism\" or the \"greater good\" - depending on whether it is being marketed as democratic or republican agenda.\n\nThere are a few winners - primarily large corporations, financial services firms, and of course politicians. However, the majority of workers are often left behind. The nationalistic backlash that you have referred to as \"noxious\" is in direct response to centralized economic planning with predictable results.\n\nThe demonization of Nationalism -  the interest in protecting a country, culture, or economy is nothing more than a sinister tool by the global elite to further their agenda.", "This is also to tell the super power to mind their own business. If they do wish to interfere in foreign land, then they shouldn't shut their doors when the refugees flee from the destructive intervention.", "Globalisation isn't good as such. \nIt has good aspects - information and cultural exchange, trade for common benefit, awareness for global issues and help to solve them, and others.\n\nBut there are bad aspects like exploitation of working people and resources in poorer countries, conflicts created, maintained and supported by the greater powers (e.g. by selling weapons to autocratic regimes), too.\n\nBut it is ironic that people in western countries - those who benefit most from globalisation are voting for nationalists who want to return to a pre-globalised world that doesn't exist any more. \n\nThey pledge that the trading aspect can be preserved in closed societies. I think they mean, that nationalistic countries will continue exploiting others without taking any responsibility. So the good aspects will disappear and the bad ones fortified. \n\nPlease think about that when voting.", "If globalization didn't mean the destruction of culture, freedom, religion, and sovereignty then people wouldn't be turning to nationalism. If the globalists want to avoid the push back then they really should approach the world with less hostility to individual freedom and quit living lives of luxury at the expense of those they claim to represent. Quit being distant rulers feigning concern for \"liberal democracy\" while pushing totalitarian socialism.", "Globalisation is not necessarily good or bad...but if it is at the cost of the individual nation's internal strength and progress, then it is questionable whether it is helpful.

Protecting your borders FROM ILLEGAL immigrants does not mean prohibit immigration.  Seems that people forget that. Taking care of illegals is a waste of resources that has to be directed on country's needs and people. There is nothing wrong with legal immigration, the problem is illegal one.

The difference now, is that the resolute forces of the understanding and belief that the quest for human dignity ought to remain a universal objective as opposed to those who would like to impose stricter limitations on human dignity and freedom, underscored by the arrogant abuse of the full hegemonic powers at their disposal...by and large, the lessons learned from the Obama years, in spite of its deep allusions of the triumph of   reason, did not see any significant reduction of the inherent turbulence \n for developing nations, who got very flimsy recognition from the so called forces of progressive change in the west...generally the argument is; that if we addressed these issues now rather than repress them, we would be better off, on our journey towards socio economic affluence...the disdain of the Trumpish way is that he would easily collaborate with is fellow tyrants in fostering 'state sponsored terror'...which will be counterproductive to the aspirations and development of the real majority.", "Way too early to think Germany will wittingly take the lead for Democratic principles.
