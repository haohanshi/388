I played Minecraft not knowing about Herobrine, I bought Minecraft PlayStation edition. I'm watching different YouTube videos of Herobrine and it's like watching a Bigfoot episode. What gets me thinking is if notch said he wasn't real why would anyone have pictures of him to the exact detail? I'm sure someone's gonna say he's real or just a myth concocted by some players who have no life and lives in their mother's basement with \" collectables\" of star wars or star trek etc. Now while playing Minecraft I did notice some odd things going on, a farm patch that's not near my farm it's just a block away from the lake it won't go away. Some have said that pyramids will form but if you look around before altering the terrain you'll see pyramids small to large and then there's mountains, from what I saw each player has always hunted for Herobrine on creative mode. I did some research and found nothing that is important like I said before it's like trying to Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster you only see images and the way to quickly debunk the sitings is saying he's not real or he's real omg let's run away. Honestly if he's in the game it means that notch himself put him in the game. Some have said that he's notches dead brother why would he put him in the game? Maybe they've worked on the game together and he past away, maybe it was his idea and he past away before getting his idea to work, maybe notch wants to see his brother and have him around and have everyone who plays Minecraft to see his brother which if you think about it for some it's creepy but to others it's a way to keep him around in a virtual world cause he can't be there in the real world. No matter how you look at it, there's no middle ground for any myth's or legends, there's always gonna be those who say he's not real the videos are a hoax and there's those who believe cold heartily that he's real. Here's what's happening to me when I play it. 1) I've seen red stone torches in caves so i take them and use wood to make a sign that says come at me bro\n2) I've seen gold blocks and again I take them and place a sign each one is different and I put why play hide and seek? \n3) I've seen mist appearing about four five blocks away and when mist does form it's about at last a hundred blocks away or more for those who don't know four blocks is the same thing when looking at someone who is standing in front of you where you have to take four steps to get closer to them.\n4) I've seen tunnels that I haven't done cause when I explore the world i torch the area and use red stone torches for rails redstone lamps and anything that you use redstone for. \n5) I enter caves and I see tunnels going straight down and so I come prepared and make ladders to go back when I'm done.\n6) I hear voices not the mob growls, screeches etc actually talking.\n7) to be afraid of Herobrine is like being scared of a roach. I saw another player running past but here's the kicker I have no WiFi there's WiFi all around me but there all password protected I play offline all the time and my house still stands even now.

I'm going to turn this heaven into a heaven nightmare!\" So, lucifer began to turn half of the clouds into hard, hard black rocks, and those rocks were so, so hot. Then, lucifer grabbed God's horses. And then, he peeled the horses fur and skin off. And those horses are now skeleton horses and they were still alive. And those horses never die in heaven, even if they were skeleton horses, they won't die in heaven, either. Then, Lucifer made rain storms and thunder storms, too, with a lot of rain drops and lighting, and thunder. Then, lucifer puts the skeleton horses in the lighting. And every time the lighting begins to crash on the ground, the skeleton horses will come out of the lighting. And those skeleton horses are now lucifer's slaves.

People buy everything af long as it had a brand on it... You guys are just abusing simpleminded folk who are gullable. Shame on you.", "If you actually look it up, for all the nay-sayers, this thing is WAY more durable than any standard usb drive.  No you don't play it ON the watch.  The whole watch feature is just a sidenote to what the product is.  The point is to have your MC on the band, so that you can plug it in to any computer, anywhere, and play on your world with your account, without having to be online and host a server.  the computer doesn't even need to have MC installed.  80 bucks is 80 bucks, but if you got it to spend, this thing is awesome.", "My user interface controls in my  Mine craft realms do not operate properly, I have imported one of my worlds twice & it claims it is downloaded but does not load but loads a completely different world from its own data bank.

I put it in to a windows 98se and the game ran fine will 45fps at a high and 20 fps low it is not a computer  i would play on all the time but in a pinch. so I am going to buy one for my wife and two kids. and the price is good you are paying for a mini computer the taps into your  video and mouse and keyboard and the game runs off the band is self that is way it is 80  for the diamond and i think 50 for the redstone. I am sorry but people need to read the specs of some thing before saying it is over priced . gameband  is cheap for what you get . and i tip my hat to them for making the band less then 100 not more .  the band is a tool just like buy a ps4 a nintendo wiiU,ora xbox 360 or xbox one to play minecraft on.  .", "Big awesome smart gameband i like diamonds ore but now you can made good idea mods Glow or Black redstone", "This is an the intended same thing as a well preserved known as to the intended recipient only and for your time to meet get the a and team to help", "My Stream Name xRuSHeR_19 live Playing minecraft", "Hello,\nJust log in and you will earn great prizes in Heroes of the Storm!\nFor further information check and join the Nexus! https://battle.net/recruit/VXPWWWQTT7"]]
