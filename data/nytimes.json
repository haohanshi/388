The whole energy in the campaign was generated by Trump and Bernie - they may agree on little but they certainly showed that both the Democratic and republican parties were clueless about the concerns of the voters. I think the congressional Republicans have already dissed Trump by saying his agenda is dead, they are going to be in control of the agenda.  It's hard to believe this because they never ever figured out how to control Trump from the day he announced.\n\nI regret that Trump was elected. He could do a lot of damage because of his ignorance and his seeming inability to want to learn.  He certainly has a feel for the pulse of a great number of Americans. If nothing else, they certainly want him to drain the swamp.

Romani is the prime minister that dragged Italy in the EU at a high price. After joining the euro prices in Italy practically doubled. Also Romani raised taxes trying desperately to stay within the 3% limit in deficit imposed by the EU. Needless to say the second time he ran against Berlusconi he lost. Berlusconi term came to an end not because he had lost confidence in the parliament but because he was forced out by the EU and Merkel via the Italian president Napolitano who chose Monti as the prime minister. Monti was never voted on by the people. Monti raised taxes, took care of the banks, and eventually was replaced by Renzi who had was elected leader of the PD party but has never won any national political race.

Consider themselves Americans, even though they are still technically \"illegal\". Now there is a real possibility they will be sent back to a country they have zero ties to. A program known as DACA that Obama signed by executive order prevents them from being deported. But that program can be rescinded by the new president and probably will be.

Just wait and see.", "Let me just run to the store and buy out all the tinfoil and bedazzlers. I am gonna make a ton of money on some tin foil hats."], ["And now we are at the part of the post-election circular firing squad where Wise Men tell us which of our values we need to jettison to please people who voted for someone endorsed by the KKK. Not. Doing. It. It never works, for one thing.", "I have to disagree with this. The Trump victory WAS the result identity politics - a stealth campaign of White Nationalism conducted through dog whistles, extremist endorsements and basically \"He says what we're thinking (and it's racist)\"...", "demanding rights under the Constitution is NOT identity politics when those rights are being denied simply because of who you are!", "\"Visitors from other countries, particularly those having trouble incorporating different ethnic groups and faiths, are amazed that we manage to pull it off. Not perfectly, of course, but certainly better than any European or Asian nation today.\" You're joking right? This is from a country that just elected Donald Trump as president and a white supremacist as his right-hand man?", "This is the same as blaming a \"mouthy\" woman for being beaten. What a horrible premise for an article. The author should feel ashamed.", "I am mixed about this article. Yes speaking about values more broadly does appeal to larger audiences but certain groups of people have issues that affect them more than others. For example are you suggesting we don't talk about immigration when addressing largely Latino or Asian Americans crowds (two groups of people who are largely affected by immigration policy). I do believe in pluralism and i do believe the way forward for democrats is by preaching universal social programs to help all Americans. But we should not discount that we live in a vibrant multi-ethnic democracy and one of two major political parties is now positioning itself as a party of overt white nationalism.", "The man who won the electoral college started his campaign by saying he was going to send Mexicans back and build a wall. He then said he'd ban Muslims from entering the country. He said black communities are essentially hell on Earth. He made fun of people with disabilities. And let's not get started on how he treats women. But it's this \"liberal identity politics\" that is the concern? I'd say the right is all about identity politics and one identity rules supreme -- white able-bodied men.", "Yes! The identity liberalism must end. It starts with academia and spreads into politics. It is the single most factor dividing societies and creating us against them mentality. NYT, you are biggest promoter of this misguided and divisive politics. Promote what is common instead of constantly harping on what is different between people for creating and exploiting vote banks.", "This piece feels like it was written by Ellison's Brother Jack. Apparently, the legitimate concerns of disenfranchised minority groups can and should only be addressed so long we can tie them to the interests of the white working class. And once the ruling elite throw the white working class a bone, we can go back to comfortably ignoring the staggering level of racial inequality in this country. After all, it isn't our fight anymore.", "The tone of the Democratic convention -- \"Stronger Together\" -- was one of unity, not divisiveness. Hillary Clinton's campaign did a pretty incredible job of uniting the voices of the many who've been (correctly) fighting for their rights and respect during the Obama years. Accountability for the horror show now upon us is with white Americans who chose to look away from naked hate tactics, not with the people who will now be the targets of that hate.", "There are lots of reasons the Dems lost the election--an unpopular candidate didn't help. But the New York Times simply refuses to acknowledge that by fixating endlessly on the fake 'email scandal'--and reporting day after day on the Wikileaks dump aimed squarely at the Clinton campaign--they elevated stories that had very little merit, and piggybacked on the broader media fascination with Clinton 'corruption' for no other reason than to turn pages. \nIs the NYT responsible for electing Trump? It's not that simple, of course. But they did play a role, and they're pretending they didn't. Meanwhile, I notice the email scandal has suddenly faded into oblivion--almost like it never really amounted to anything...", "You keep saying \"identity politics\" but what you mean is the basic assertion that minorities of all stripes deserve the same human rights and dignity as everyone else. You can't surrender identity politics without surrendering your humanity. This article reeks of the entitled perspective of someone who takes for granted their place in society and has never had the legislative machinery weaponized against them, never had any their rights questioned or stripped away. Go back to your ivory tower and leave politics to those of us who have some skin in the game!", "Full disclosure, my reaction is to the headline alone. My question is -- couldn't a case be made that *White* Identity Politics are exactly what did win this election?", "Forget it. As long as we suffer for our identities, we will run and drive elections accordingly. And some of us will vote to protect other vulnerable people, as well.", "I'm trying to read opinions different from my own growth, and this is an example. Colorblind liberalism in a post racial America was and is not real. As evidenced by the reaction to the outcome of this election. Those of us from marginalized (and now disenfranchised groups, thanks Supreme Court for cutting off the Voting Rights Act at the knees) groups experience this political transition in a differentiated form of oppression BECAUSE of our diversity; Muslim-religious oppression, LGBTQI people-homophobia, Asians and Latinos-xenophobia (we are not even seen as Americans), and Black people-racial oppression, etc And that's not even talking about our INTERSECTIONAL oppressions. Even public discourse reinforces this when talking about \"working class Americans.\" I'm a working class American, but they're actually talking about white people. In summary, NOPE.", "Yet Trump voters and GOP are allowed to use identity politics: white nationalism, anti-LGBT, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrants. Getting annoyed by these editorials that claim the end of some era--when it is only four years, folks, until another election.", "We underestimated the amount of hate and racism in this country as well as the lack of education. Unfortunately, the republicans now have a vested interest in keeping the masses ignorant, makes them easier to take advantage of. The situation is going to get much worse before it gets better.  :(", "One of the reasons we seem \"obsessed\" with identity politics, is that journalists, on and individual level, happen to be the people using identity politics to further their careers, thus it's constantly being shoved down our throats by the media.", "If it wasn't for the 'identity' politics this writer is so keen to dismiss, the US would not have seen the huge advances in Black, female and LGBT civil rights - positive developments any true liberal will applaud. Meanwhile, his remark about Transgender people in Egypt (Where an odious crackdown against LGBT people is occurring) is not only insulting but misleading - media outlets are quite capable of covering many different stories and should absolutely report on the plight of persecuted groups. \n\nYou could also be forgiven for thinking the Obama Presidency never happened while reading this analysis. The reality however is that Obama's winning coalition was based on an explicit recognition of the power of diversity which twice propelled him to victory and with a majority of the vote on both occasions. Trump meanwhile hasn't even secured a plurality and will take office despite substantially more people voting for his opponent. \n\nIt would be a mistake if Democrats and progressives were to follow the advice contained in this piece, which effectively calls for the repudiation of the Obama coalition. Instead they need to find the right candidate who can harness its winning potential.", "Yes we should all want everyone to succeed, but just saying it doesn't make it happen. Why is it so hard to understand that the middle class in middle America is being squeezed out of existence. Not just manufacturing of cars, but teachers, firemen, police, waitresses, cooks etc etc etc. The coasts may have better pay, I don't know, but we are going broke!", "This is the great paradox of the Democrat platform.\n\nSure you can balkanize the population into this, that, and the other little put-upon, exploited minority group.  Once you convince people to \"identify\" this way you can pander to them and control them.\n\nBut at the same time you have disenfranchised everyone from their own sovereignty.  We see your last minute desperate campaign to \"get out the vote\".   And did it work?  No!  Gee, I wonder why.", "A majority win is not a loss.The fact that Hillary won the popular vote tells me that most folks are decent people--no matter how many racketeers ride luxurious limousines to a lofty mansion in Washington DC.", "Dominant groups think up the identities, and force everyone else into defensive mode, and create identity politics. It isn't the oppressed and marginalized who do it...Let's see. Democrats won the popular vote, but failed to motivate enough liberals and centrists to the polls in a handful of swing states. Though most of those unswayed or unmotivated voters are whites who helped elect Obama twice, the conclusion is that it's Latinxs and Black people who are the problem, though only 4% of all votes were votes for Trump from those groups--23% of Latinxs and 8% of Black people, as opposed to 58% of white voters for Trump. There was no central motivating message in the Clinton campaign for any voters, the kind of messages that are crucial to winning presidential elections. There was no liberal mirror-image equivalent of \"Build that wall!\" But yeah, the Democrats are gonna go with blaming this loss on the Black people and Latinxs. And it won't be enough to have two parties tripping over themselves to appease that straight able-bodied WASP male middle-upper middle demographic (Gee, there's something new and novel) because that demo won't be appeased unless everyone else is getting the shaft, or so the thinking goes. It's thinking that's offensive to every demographic, and tragic for most. But, Democrat leaders think, why not? The Democrats always figure they can do anything they want to the marginalized, and still have their votes. This country has two very broken and very cynical major political parties."]]
