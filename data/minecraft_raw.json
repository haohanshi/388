When I followed the usual process of clicks to find the world I have been working on for over a year, I was suddenly dropped into a world I did not recognise. At first, I thought my world had been wiped of everything I have done. All my settings were wrong too, so I had to change the level of brightness, and the control settings, before I could investigate this unrecogniseable world with my name on it. Turns out the world is a brand new unmapped world, so not even mine. Since then, having left it alone for a couple of days, I tried again. The format has returned to one I recognise, which gave me comfort, until I clicked on my world, and the whole game has frozen.

I played Minecraft not knowing about Herobrine, I bought Minecraft PlayStation edition. I'm watching different YouTube videos of Herobrine and it's like watching a Bigfoot episode. What gets me thinking is if notch said he wasn't real why would anyone have pictures of him to the exact detail? I'm sure someone's gonna say he's real or just a myth concocted by some players who have no life and lives in their mother's basement with \" collectables\" of star wars or star trek etc. Now while playing Minecraft I did notice some odd things going on, a farm patch that's not near my farm it's just a block away from the lake it won't go away. Some have said that pyramids will form but if you look around before altering the terrain you'll see pyramids small to large and then there's mountains, from what I saw each player has always hunted for Herobrine on creative mode. I did some research and found nothing that is important like I said before it's like trying to Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster you only see images and the way to quickly debunk the sitings is saying he's not real or he's real omg let's run away. Honestly if he's in the game it means that notch himself put him in the game. Some have said that he's notches dead brother why would he put him in the game? Maybe they've worked on the game together and he past away, maybe it was his idea and he past away before getting his idea to work, maybe notch wants to see his brother and have him around and have everyone who plays Minecraft to see his brother which if you think about it for some it's creepy but to others it's a way to keep him around in a virtual world cause he can't be there in the real world. No matter how you look at it, there's no middle ground for any myth's or legends, there's always gonna be those who say he's not real the videos are a hoax and there's those who believe cold heartily that he's real. Here's what's happening to me when I play it. 1) I've seen red stone torches in caves so i take them and use wood to make a sign that says come at me bro\n2) I've seen gold blocks and again I take them and place a sign each one is different and I put why play hide and seek? \n3) I've seen mist appearing about four five blocks away and when mist does form it's about at last a hundred blocks away or more for those who don't know four blocks is the same thing when looking at someone who is standing in front of you where you have to take four steps to get closer to them.\n4) I've seen tunnels that I haven't done cause when I explore the world i torch the area and use red stone torches for rails redstone lamps and anything that you use redstone for. \n5) I enter caves and I see tunnels going straight down and so I come prepared and make ladders to go back when I'm done.\n6) I hear voices not the mob growls, screeches etc actually talking.\n7) to be afraid of Herobrine is like being scared of a roach. I saw another player running past but here's the kicker I have no WiFi there's WiFi all around me but there all password protected I play offline all the time and my house still stands even now. Is it possible that I have no wood at my main house, it's all either stone brick, glass, cobble stone, nether bricks, quarts.

Then I looked at a lightning bolt on the ground and it wasn't destroyed, but when those lighting bolts crashed to the ground, the skeleton horses were spawned. And my history I think about the skeleton horses that they came from the lighting in the sky, is when those old horses died, they went to heaven with God. And suddenly, Lucifer the devil came out of the hot place, and then, he went to heaven, and he said. \" God. I'm going to turn this heaven into a heaven nightmare!\" So, lucifer began to turn half of the clouds into hard, hard black rocks, and those rocks were so, so hot. Then, lucifer grabbed God's horses. And then, he peeled the horses fur and skin off. And those horses are now skeleton horses and they were still alive. And those horses never die in heaven, even if they were skeleton horses, they won't die in heaven, either. Then, Lucifer made rain storms and thunder storms, too, with a lot of rain drops and lighting, and thunder. Then, lucifer puts the skeleton horses in the lighting. And every time the lighting begins to crash on the ground, the skeleton horses will come out of the lighting. And those skeleton horses are now lucifer's slaves.

I thought it was a problem with one server but no. Every single server that I go to, either mini games or classic (Eg: Prison, Factions, ect) there is at least 20+ hackers online, and a week has been gone and nothing happened about those hackers because they are still there. Very upsetting, seriously considering of not playing Minecraft anymore. I know it's hard to catch all hackers but still, it is very annoying.

I have been able to play Minecraft on PC just fine for several years, then formatted my computer sometime last year; I was still able to log in to my account just fine at the time, however after a break I recently decided to get back into it with some friends, at which point I discovered I could no longer log in. The saved credentials were no longer working, and none of my passwords worked either. I thought, okay maybe I've forgotten my password or something, so I went to try and access the password reset function. I have tried this over twenty times and the email does not come through after about a week of trying. The fact that my email is not registering a reset option is I think pretty clear proof that my account has been compromised in some fashion. I have therefore contacted support to get my email reset back to its original, and yet I am still waiting several days later with absolutely no contact. I understand it is a busy period, but it would be really nice if the website at the very least registered an automatic response to the support claim, so it can be tracked. Ideally I would like a response sooner rather than later though, as it is getting close to a week now with no response whatsoever."}], [{"from": {"name": "Jason M.

And paintings of video games like FNaF, Skyrim, Slender, Nyan Cat, ect.\n\n6: Minigames\nAnother thing I hope Mojang/Microsoft add is minigames, so you can play minigames like Block Party, Hide and Seek, ect with friends to keep every Minecrafter amused.\n\n7: Emerald materials\nThere's only one use for emeralds, and that's trading them with villagers, which is kinda useless. We should be able to craft emerald materials like swords, pickaxes, axes, shovels, ect.\n\nSorry if there's too much scary stuff in my list. I'm just obsessed with Creepypastas and FNaF. I hope everybody has a nice day! :)"}, {"from": {"name": "Marco Trozzo", "id": "10153916502106691"}, "created_time": "2015-12-07T16:33:22+0000", "id": "948952128473610_949052261796930", "message": "The WiiU has been an obvious ideal platform for Minecraft for years. \n\n3 years later, I sincerely hope the fanbase treats the game as an afterthought as you did them. \n\nRidiculous that it took this long."}, {"from": {"name": "Berk Eker", "id": "706686539484912"}, "created_time": "2015-12-07T16:07:03+0000", "id": "948952128473610_949041915131298", "message": "hey minecraft can you put helping villager that mine stuff or listens to you that would be great and a new ore like amber please do it it would be more fun."}, {"from": {"name": "Alex Hudson", "id": "1285987984792820"}, "created_time": "2015-12-08T03:20:04+0000", "id": "948952128473610_949262601775896", "message": "Melissa Langdale be sure to not tell Callum that Minecraft is coming to Wii U \ud83d\ude1c\u263a\ufe0f"}, {"from": {"name": "Jeffrey Hardee", "id": "345182239177782"}, "created_time": "2015-12-24T07:19:43+0000", "id": "948952128473610_956670867701736", "message": "minecraft is on nentendo fhouyfiuersgr89wcyeruifvydebyuael"}, {"from": {"name": "Lori Palmer", "id": "10209539073487286"}, "created_time": "2015-12-07T17:32:50+0000", "id": "948952128473610_949081068460716", "message": "Is Minecraft available for Nintendo DS?"}, {"from": {"name": "David Parker", "id": "1253760334695185"}, "created_time": "2015-12-07T17:10:58+0000", "id": "948952128473610_949071605128329", "message": "This'll make Minecraft like EVERY OTHER GAME EVER."}, {"from": {"name": "Furkan Okumus", "id": "1119182941468650"}, "created_time": "2015-12-12T11:01:38+0000", "id": "948952128473610_951104794925010", "message": "kaliteli minecraft pvp serveri arayanlar gelsin girenler beni WampyMan \u00e7a\u011f\u0131rd\u0131 desin UstaPVP.Nitrado.Net"}, {"from": {"name": "Matija Lakato\u0161", "id": "1800944143499685"}, "created_time": "2015-12-07T14:31:35+0000", "id": "948952128473610_948972601804896", "message": "Yes, destroy minecraft even more.

I am sorry but people need to read the specs of some thing before saying it is over priced . gameband  is cheap for what you get . and i tip my hat to them for making the band less then 100 not more .  the band is a tool just like buy a ps4 a nintendo wiiU,ora xbox 360 or xbox one to play minecraft on.  ."}, {"from": {"name": "Ashley Webley", "id": "585135805022207"}, "created_time": "2015-12-05T16:57:47+0000", "id": "942863722415784_948175071884649", "message": "Big awesome smart gameband i like diamonds ore but now you can made good idea mods Glow or Black redstone"}, {"from": {"name": "Jonathan Palmer", "id": "337727009916997"}, "created_time": "2015-12-05T04:00:53+0000", "id": "942863722415784_947963468572476", "message": "This is an the intended same thing as a well preserved known as to the intended recipient only and for your time to meet get the a and team to help"}, {"from": {"name": "Marvin Ettings", "id": "1023368444441196"}, "created_time": "2015-11-23T20:35:30+0000", "id": "942863722415784_942983195737170", "message": "My Stream Name xRuSHeR_19 live Playing minecraft"}, {"from": {"name": "Blajan Andrei Ioan", "id": "1143250479055947"}, "created_time": "2015-12-14T09:29:10+0000", "id": "942863722415784_951976024837887", "message": "Hello,\nJust log in and you will earn great prizes in Heroes of the Storm!\nFor further information check and join the Nexus! https://battle.net/recruit/VXPWWWQTT7"}, {"from": {"name": "Punya'wee Seangsri", "id": "631770127028144"}, "created_time": "2015-11-27T09:59:14+0000", "id": "942863722415784_944427545592735", "message": "\"WELCOME TO SERVER\"  MCMMO SERVER GAME V 1.7.2 \n\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e34\u0e1f\u0e14\u0e35\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19 \u0e21\u0e35\u0e22\u0e28 \u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e04\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e40\u0e0b\u0e34\u0e1f\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48 \u0e41\u0e19\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e15\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e14 IP:play.gm-colo.com:25514 \u0e41\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e21\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e19\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e08\u0e38\u0e4a\u0e1a\u0e46"}]]
