I pushed through page after page, line after line, of the exact same story but missing the most important pieces- the characters! Edythe is NO Edward and Beau is NO Bella. \n\nThe reason it worked so well the first time was due to the personalities of the characters.  I never thought of Bella as the damsel in distress. In fact, Edward was more of the distressed one and they equally saved each other.\n\nThis reimagined story was sloppy and quickly written.  Especially at the end.  I was extremely disappointed at some of SM 's choices in wording. \"Apparently I smelled REALLY good to vampires\" (Beau explaining his situation in a supposed tense scene at the end) Seriously? This super well-spoken guy suddenly becomes horrible at speaking? I just wasn't buying it.  I literally would have read ANYTHING with Stephenie's name attached but this was crap.\n\nYou shouldn't mess with a good thing unless you're rewriting the entire thing.

Basically obsessed with it.  However, even though I DID sit down and read the entire gender swap thing today, I was completely let down.  I pushed through page after page, line after line, of the exact same story but missing the most important pieces- the characters! Edythe is NO Edward and Beau is NO Bella. \n\nThe reason it worked so well the first time was due to the personalities of the characters.  I never thought of Bella as the damsel in distress. In fact, Edward was more of the distressed one and they equally saved each other.\n\nThis reimagined story was sloppy and quickly written.  Especially at the end.  I was extremely disappointed at some of SM 's choices in wording. \"Apparently I smelled REALLY good to vampires\" (Beau explaining his situation in a supposed tense scene at the end) Seriously? This super well-spoken guy suddenly becomes horrible at speaking? I just wasn't buying it.  I literally would have read ANYTHING with Stephenie's name attached but this was crap.\n\nYou shouldn't mess with a good thing unless you're rewriting the entire thing.  I kept trying to figure out which new character was the reverse gender character (so Alfie is Alice and Royal is Rosalie...) I couldn't even buy into the new characters.
