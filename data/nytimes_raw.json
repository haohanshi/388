If you remember in the 1900's to 1960 majority of the Americans used to consume vegetables and moderated their diet in the intake of meat. Fast forward to the 70's when Americans began to consume more meat. Doctors say that majority of the animals are injected with hormones to make them grow fast and when the animals are killed they exhibit fear which releases the toxins in the system. The doctors acknowledge that these non-veg foods contain carcinogens which cause cancer, Parkinson's disease and others. Now we know what to eat and how much to eat.\n2) Americans put a man on the moon and their downfall commenced. Moon is a planet that influences the human mind and influences the sea tides. Once Neil went into space Americans became couch potatoes, consumed more food, lyrics became profane, elders were not respected by the children and music became louder. Once you put a man on Mars you can well imagine the consequences as Mars influences wars and is a red planet.\n3) America's debt has reached US$ 20 trillion. The consequences would be if interest rates are not raised to 2.5-3.5% would include (as predicted by Gerald Celente) hyperinflation, food riots and 90% depreciation of the dollar. The dollar would become worthless and standard of living would fall with more people becoming poor in 2019. Prophecies mention China and Russia would launch nuclear weapons and occupy USA in 2037.

They should realize that he values loyalty and they have shown no loyalty to him, just disrespect. Trump also must realize that the traditional Republican positions will not fly with his supporters. In reality, Trump is the leader of a third party movement.  He has nothing to gain from licking the boots of the Republicans, and most certainly the Democrats are already calling upon him to keep his word on populist objectives.  The whole energy in the campaign was generated by Trump and Bernie - they may agree on little but they certainly showed that both the Democratic and republican parties were clueless about the concerns of the voters. I think the congressional Republicans have already dissed Trump by saying his agenda is dead, they are going to be in control of the agenda.  It's hard to believe this because they never ever figured out how to control Trump from the day he announced.\n\nI regret that Trump was elected.

I assume you mean they don't pay federal income taxes since it's likely that they don't work while attending school. They also need to pay up to 3x the tuition and fees that American students pay to attend an American graduate program. You may not care, but your professors and university administrative staff surely do. The revenue for their generous salaries and bonuses has to come from somewhere and clearly American students' dollars and federal funds are not cutting it.  Foreign students are seen as cash cows by most American universities. I think this student is doing the right thing in reconsidering attending an American university. I attended a graduate program at one of the most popular public universities in Indiana and had a professor who would jump at the opportunity to ridicule and embarrass the foreign students in some of my courses simply because he could (was tenured) and because some foreign students from a particular country would give just about anything to be able to attend an American university. Also in Indiana there was a high school student from an Asian country who was attacked with a machete upon leaving a convenience store and the attacker claimed that it was an attack motivated by her race/ national origin. Both of these incidents were pre- Trump/Pence era.

Romani is the prime minister that dragged Italy in the EU at a high price. After joining the euro prices in Italy practically doubled. Also Romani raised taxes trying desperately to stay within the 3% limit in deficit imposed by the EU. Needless to say the second time he ran against Berlusconi he lost. Berlusconi term came to an end not because he had lost confidence in the parliament but because he was forced out by the EU and Merkel via the Italian president Napolitano who chose Monti as the prime minister. Monti was never voted on by the people. Monti raised taxes, took care of the banks, and eventually was replaced by Renzi who had was elected leader of the PD party but has never won any national political race. Renzi continues as prime minister selected not by the people but by Napolitano and the EU. This sounds like a mess and it is.

It's not even close to the first political curtain speech, and its nowhere near the loudest. Judging from where Pence was sitting, I'm guessing (as others have posited as well) he paid little to nothing for his seat. People who are well known often get comped tickets so that they'll go tell everyone they know how great the show is. Theater is not based on customer service. You are not owed anything other than a performance because you've shelled out for a ticket. Your ticket comes with all of the other things that happen during a theatrical performance, including the curtain speech. It has been used to convey political messages since the dawn of people acting out stories on stage. You have no right to dictate their actions when you have no idea what it's like to be in their position. Theater has always been provocative and progressive. We will not change just because you have discovered us and we don't fit into your world. This is our world. You are always welcome, but we will not tolerate racism, bigotry, or any other form of malice directed at members of our society. We will not be silenced. We will not be brushed aside.

What is the idea, after singing, of one of the brethren standing up here to open this meeting by prayer? Is he not our spokesman, the mouthpiece, and should we not, while he utters the sentences, have those sentences pass through our minds in a prayer as a congregation, and when he has finished it, endorse the same by saying \"amen.\" What is the meaning of \"amen?\" So be it. Well, I noticed today that there were few \"amens.\" Why is this? Did we not endorse the prayer? Did we not sanction it? I should think if we did we would naturally say \"amen\" \u2014so let it be. But I will tell you what I am afraid of\u2014I am afraid of the Latter-day Saints getting into a form of religion and being no better off than their neighbors, or getting into the habit of going to meeting and hearing the singing and praying and the discourse without their having any influence whatever upon our minds any more than perchance to criticize. I cannot understand how that kind of a worship can be acceptable to God. If I understand it, He requires our hearts, and He desires when we pray that we mean what we say. What is the meaning of prayer? Why, it is to earnestly ask something that we require with all our hearts. All who are in fellowship of the Holy Ghost, will ask God for His Spirit to be in their hearts in all their business relations, even, that they might not soil their hands, but keep them clean and their hearts pure, that they might merit His approbation. The Lord Jesus Christ encouraged His disciples to pray\u2014to pray without ceasing.

This election wasn't, as the author seems to imply, a defeat for identity politics\u2014it was a resounding victory.  Trump won, not by presenting himself as the champion of conservative political philosophy (in fact, much of what Trump said on the campaign trail was a repudiation of longstanding conservative positions on various issues), but by presenting himself as the champion of that segment of American society that feels ill-at-ease with the social, cultural, and (let's be honest here) demographic changes that have taken place in this country over the past several decades. That is a form of identity politics just as much as radical feminism, the LGBTQ movement, or Black Lives Matter are forms of identity politics.\n\nNow, I certainly agree with the author that identity politics is bad, and we need to find some way to get past it.  In my view, there are really only two types of political movements: those that seek to build walls and those that seek to build bridges\u2014i.e. those that feel the need to divide people into separate groups based on their differences and those that believe in trying to unite people into a single community based on their commonalities.  Identity politics of all stripes\u2014from the radical social justice movements on the left to the reactionary nationalist movements on the right\u2014belong to the former category.  Liberalism (in the traditional sense of the word, not the way it is used in contemporary American politics) belongs to the latter.  The United States used to be a truly liberal nation, and both major parties were broadly liberal\u2014one tended towards progressive liberalism and the other towards conservative liberalism, but both accepted the core values of liberalism:  individual rights, freedom of conscience and expression, limited government, the rule of law, robust protections for civil liberties, a market economy, private enterprise, pluralism, tolerance, reason, science, etc..  I long for a return to liberalism and the Enlightenment values that it represents.\n\nSadly, in recent decades we have seen the rise of illiberal political movements on both the far left and the far right that reject the values of the Enlightenment, and liberalism itself is now under attack from both sides.  Both of our major parties have faced insurgencies from illiberal, anti-Enlightenment movements, and both have been forced to make concessions to these movements.  It could even be argued that one of the two parties has, for years now, been dominated by its illiberal wing, forcing many liberals to leave the party in droves.  But this is the first election in which the winner is someone who seems to have no regard for the core liberal values that America was founded on, and who praises\u2014and is in turn praised by\u2014the leaders of some of the world's most illiberal regimes.  This election wasn't a rejection of the illiberal politics of identity.  A culture of \"political correctness\" is certainly illiberal (it goes against the core liberal principle of freedom of expression), but it's nowhere near as illiberal as a proposal to ban people from entering this country based on their religion (which goes against the liberal principles of tolerance, pluralism, and freedom of conscience\u2014and also reason, since such a ban would be irrational).  So I must reject the claim that this election was some sort of victory for the opponents of identity politics.  It was quite the opposite.\n\nAnd I seriously doubt that the lesson that the Democratic Party is going to learn from this election is that they should stop pandering to identity groups based on race, gender, sexuality, etc.  If anything, I fear that the party will be driven farther to the left (Clinton, after all, was a centrist candidate\u2014she may have paid lip service to identity politics, but at heart she is a pragmatic liberal), and will be taken over by its radical wing, which includes not only anti-establishment populists like Bernie Sanders but also the identity politics crowd.  I don't see much good coming out of this election for either party, and certainly not for American politics as a whole."}, {"from": {"name": "Adam Long", "id": "10211258874132072"}, "created_time": "2016-11-18T16:43:43+0000", "id": "10150974267859999_10150974373304999", "message": "If it wasn't for the 'identity' politics this writer is so keen to dismiss, the US would not have seen the huge advances in Black, female and LGBT civil rights - positive developments any true liberal will applaud.

Consider themselves Americans, even though they are still technically \"illegal\". Now there is a real possibility they will be sent back to a country they have zero ties to. A program known as DACA that Obama signed by executive order prevents them from being deported. But that program can be rescinded by the new president and probably will be. Trump may have said most recently that he will be looking at deporting only criminals first. But his whole campaign he sang a different tune about deporting all illegals.

Doctors say that majority of the animals are injected with hormones to make them grow fast and when the animals are killed they exhibit fear which releases the toxins in the system. The doctors acknowledge that these non-veg foods contain carcinogens which cause cancer, Parkinson's disease and others. Now we know what to eat and how much to eat.\n2) Americans put a man on the moon and their downfall commenced. Moon is a planet that influences the human mind and influences the sea tides. Once Neil went into space Americans became couch potatoes, consumed more food, lyrics became profane, elders were not respected by the children and music became louder.

I assume you mean they don't pay federal income taxes since it's likely that they don't work while attending school.

You may not care, but your professors and university administrative staff surely do. The revenue for their generous salaries and bonuses has to come from somewhere and clearly American students' dollars and federal funds are not cutting it.  Foreign students are seen as cash cows by most American universities. I think this student is doing the right thing in reconsidering attending an American university. I attended a graduate program at one of the most popular public universities in Indiana and had a professor who would jump at the opportunity to ridicule and embarrass the foreign students in some of my courses simply because he could (was tenured) and because some foreign students from a particular country would give just about anything to be able to attend an American university. Also in Indiana there was a high school student from an Asian country who was attacked with a machete upon leaving a convenience store and the attacker claimed that it was an attack motivated by her race/ national origin.

Berlusconi term came to an end not because he had lost confidence in the parliament but because he was forced out by the EU and Merkel via the Italian president Napolitano who chose Monti as the prime minister. Monti was never voted on by the people. Monti raised taxes, took care of the banks, and eventually was replaced by Renzi who had was elected leader of the PD party but has never won any national political race. Renzi continues as prime minister selected not by the people but by Napolitano and the EU. This sounds like a mess and it is. Copy any Italian thing that you like but never, ever their politics or political system or judicial system. Currently Italy has a parliament that was elected by a law that was declared unconstitutional. The current president Mattarella was elected by this parliament and the current prime minister was selected by one person Napolitano under pressure from the EU and approved by an illegal parliament."}, {"from": {"name": "Richard Cruz", "id": "1539025712779292"}, "created_time": "2016-11-19T16:28:58+0000", "id": "10150975616199999_10150975683844999", "message": "Why don't the progressive liberal Democrats look to their own ranks before casting aspersions with regard to Trump's cabinet picks labeled as being racist or bigots?

It's not even close to the first political curtain speech, and its nowhere near the loudest. Judging from where Pence was sitting, I'm guessing (as others have posited as well) he paid little to nothing for his seat. People who are well known often get comped tickets so that they'll go tell everyone they know how great the show is. Theater is not based on customer service. You are not owed anything other than a performance because you've shelled out for a ticket. Your ticket comes with all of the other things that happen during a theatrical performance, including the curtain speech. It has been used to convey political messages since the dawn of people acting out stories on stage. You have no right to dictate their actions when you have no idea what it's like to be in their position. Theater has always been provocative and progressive. We will not change just because you have discovered us and we don't fit into your world. This is our world.

What is the idea, after singing, of one of the brethren standing up here to open this meeting by prayer? Is he not our spokesman, the mouthpiece, and should we not, while he utters the sentences, have those sentences pass through our minds in a prayer as a congregation, and when he has finished it, endorse the same by saying \"amen.\" What is the meaning of \"amen?\" So be it. Well, I noticed today that there were few \"amens.\" Why is this? Did we not endorse the prayer? Did we not sanction it? I should think if we did we would naturally say \"amen\" \u2014so let it be. But I will tell you what I am afraid of\u2014I am afraid of the Latter-day Saints getting into a form of religion and being no better off than their neighbors, or getting into the habit of going to meeting and hearing the singing and praying and the discourse without their having any influence whatever upon our minds any more than perchance to criticize. I cannot understand how that kind of a worship can be acceptable to God. If I understand it, He requires our hearts, and He desires when we pray that we mean what we say. What is the meaning of prayer? Why, it is to earnestly ask something that we require with all our hearts. All who are in fellowship of the Holy Ghost, will ask God for His Spirit to be in their hearts in all their business relations, even, that they might not soil their hands, but keep them clean and their hearts pure, that they might merit His approbation. The Lord Jesus Christ encouraged His disciples to pray\u2014to pray without ceasing.

This election wasn't, as the author seems to imply, a defeat for identity politics\u2014it was a resounding victory.  Trump won, not by presenting himself as the champion of conservative political philosophy (in fact, much of what Trump said on the campaign trail was a repudiation of longstanding conservative positions on various issues), but by presenting himself as the champion of that segment of American society that feels ill-at-ease with the social, cultural, and (let's be honest here) demographic changes that have taken place in this country over the past several decades. That is a form of identity politics just as much as radical feminism, the LGBTQ movement, or Black Lives Matter are forms of identity politics.\n\nNow, I certainly agree with the author that identity politics is bad, and we need to find some way to get past it.  In my view, there are really only two types of political movements: those that seek to build walls and those that seek to build bridges\u2014i.e. those that feel the need to divide people into separate groups based on their differences and those that believe in trying to unite people into a single community based on their commonalities.  Identity politics of all stripes\u2014from the radical social justice movements on the left to the reactionary nationalist movements on the right\u2014belong to the former category.  Liberalism (in the traditional sense of the word, not the way it is used in contemporary American politics) belongs to the latter.  The United States used to be a truly liberal nation, and both major parties were broadly liberal\u2014one tended towards progressive liberalism and the other towards conservative liberalism, but both accepted the core values of liberalism:  individual rights, freedom of conscience and expression, limited government, the rule of law, robust protections for civil liberties, a market economy, private enterprise, pluralism, tolerance, reason, science, etc..  I long for a return to liberalism and the Enlightenment values that it represents.\n\nSadly, in recent decades we have seen the rise of illiberal political movements on both the far left and the far right that reject the values of the Enlightenment, and liberalism itself is now under attack from both sides.  Both of our major parties have faced insurgencies from illiberal, anti-Enlightenment movements, and both have been forced to make concessions to these movements.  It could even be argued that one of the two parties has, for years now, been dominated by its illiberal wing, forcing many liberals to leave the party in droves.  But this is the first election in which the winner is someone who seems to have no regard for the core liberal values that America was founded on, and who praises\u2014and is in turn praised by\u2014the leaders of some of the world's most illiberal regimes.  This election wasn't a rejection of the illiberal politics of identity.  A culture of \"political correctness\" is certainly illiberal (it goes against the core liberal principle of freedom of expression), but it's nowhere near as illiberal as a proposal to ban people from entering this country based on their religion (which goes against the liberal principles of tolerance, pluralism, and freedom of conscience\u2014and also reason, since such a ban would be irrational).  So I must reject the claim that this election was some sort of victory for the opponents of identity politics.  It was quite the opposite.\n\nAnd I seriously doubt that the lesson that the Democratic Party is going to learn from this election is that they should stop pandering to identity groups based on race, gender, sexuality, etc.  If anything, I fear that the party will be driven farther to the left (Clinton, after all, was a centrist candidate\u2014she may have paid lip service to identity politics, but at heart she is a pragmatic liberal), and will be taken over by its radical wing, which includes not only anti-establishment populists like Bernie Sanders but also the identity politics crowd.  I don't see much good coming out of this election for either party, and certainly not for American politics as a whole."}, {"from": {"name": "Adam Long", "id": "10211258874132072"}, "created_time": "2016-11-18T16:43:43+0000", "id": "10150974267859999_10150974373304999", "message": "If it wasn't for the 'identity' politics this writer is so keen to dismiss, the US would not have seen the huge advances in Black, female and LGBT civil rights - positive developments any true liberal will applaud.

Though most of those unswayed or unmotivated voters are whites who helped elect Obama twice, the conclusion is that it's Latinxs and Black people who are the problem, though only 4% of all votes were votes for Trump from those groups--23% of Latinxs and 8% of Black people, as opposed to 58% of white voters for Trump. There was no central motivating message in the Clinton campaign for any voters, the kind of messages that are crucial to winning presidential elections. There was no liberal mirror-image equivalent of \"Build that wall!\" But yeah, the Democrats are gonna go with blaming this loss on the Black people and Latinxs. And it won't be enough to have two parties tripping over themselves to appease that straight able-bodied WASP male middle-upper middle demographic (Gee, there's something new and novel) because that demo won't be appeased unless everyone else is getting the shaft, or so the thinking goes.
