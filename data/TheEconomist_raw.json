Thus, Arch\u00e6opteryx is assumed to be a transitional form that branched off from its dinosaur ancestors and started to fly for the first time. This imaginary tale appears in almost all evolutionist publications.\n\nEvolutionists pronounce the name of one single creature in response. This is the fossil of a bird called Arch\u00e6opteryx, one of the most widely-known so-called transitional forms among the very few that evolutionists still defend.\n\nrch\u00e6opteryx, the so-called ancestor of present-day birds according to evolutionists, lived approximately 150 million years ago. The theory holds that some small dinosaurs, such as Velociraptors or Dromeosaurs, evolved by acquiring wings and then starting to fly. Thus, Arch\u00e6opteryx is assumed to be a transitional form that branched off from its dinosaur ancestors and started to fly for the first time.\n\nHowever, the latest studies of Arch\u00e6opteryx fossils indicate that this creature is absolutely not a transitional form, but an extinct species of bird, having some insignificant differences from present-day birds.\n\nThe thesis that Arch\u00e6opteryx was a \"half-bird\" that could not fly perfectly was popular among evolutionist circles until not long ago. The absence of a sternum (breastbone) in this creature was held up as the most important evidence that this bird could not fly properly. (The sternum is a bone found under the thorax to which the muscles required for flight are attached. In our day, this breastbone is observed in all flying and non-flying birds, and even in bats, a flying mammal which belongs to a very different family.)\n\nHowever, the seventh Arch\u00e6opteryx fossil, which was found in 1992, caused great astonishment among evolutionists. The reason was that in this recently discovered fossil, the breastbone that was long assumed by evolutionists to be missing was discovered to have existed after all. This fossil was described in Nature magazine as follows:\n\nThe recently discovered seventh specimen of the Arch\u00e6opteryx preserves a partial, rectangular sternum, long suspected but never previously documented. This attests to its strong flight muscles.47\n\nThis discovery invalidated the mainstay of the claims that Arch\u00e6opteryx was a half-bird that could not fly properly.\n\nMoreover, the structure of the bird's feathers became one of the most important pieces of evidence confirming that Arch\u00e6opteryx was a flying bird in the real sense. The asymmetric feather structure of Arch\u00e6opteryx is indistinguishable from that of birds living today, and indicates that it could fly perfectly well. As the eminent paleontologist Carl O. Dunbar states, \"because of its feathers [Arch\u00e6opteryx is] distinctly to be classed as a bird.\" 48\n\nAnother fact that was revealed by the structure of Arch\u00e6opteryx's feathers was its warm-blooded metabolism. As was discussed above, reptiles and dinosaurs are cold-blooded animals whose body heat fluctuates with the temperature of their environment, rather than being homeostatically regulated. A very important function of the feathers on birds is the maintenance of a constant body temperature. The fact that Arch\u00e6opteryx had feathers showed that it was a real, warm-blooded bird that needed to regulate its body heat, in contrast to dinosaurs.\n.............SOURCE.....................You can read Harun Yahya's book The Evolution Deceit online, share it on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, download it to your computer, use it in your homework and theses, and publish, copy or reproduce it on your own web sites or blogs without paying any copyright fee, so long as you acknowledge this site as the reference."}, {"from": {"name": "Ariff Setiawann", "id": "1873646776192072"}, "created_time": "2016-11-20T08:41:02+0000", "id": "10154791943474060_10154791949454060", "message": "<3 YES!!

However, unemployment figures are low in the US and there is talk of a shortage of labor in e.g. the construction sector. This points to wage increase and thus price level rises in the near to mid future. All of this does not pose immediate threats to inflation but the Fed most likely will start to slowly abandon its low interest rate policy to keep inflation expectations in check. Higher interest rates are also necessary to attract foreign investors and borrowers to the US in order to finance Mr Trump's infrastructure spending. So in the medium term I would assume a spike in interest rates and also in inflation (from a rather low base right now). This would also put upward pressure on the US Dollar which already can be seen. If Mr Trump is, in addition to that, pursuing a more protectionist trade policy, then both domestic prices as well as currency value of the US Dollar vis-a-vis the Euro and the Renminbi will increase. US i.e. the US loses competitiveness. Americans will also find that credit financing for e.g. houses will become more expensive. This will then act as a break on consumption and work against the demand impulse from government spending. In the longer term, both effects might cancel each other out and the US economy will have higher price levels but not necessarily more employment. Regardless of that, the competitive position as regards the US Dollar will be weaker unless the ECB and other central banks start to increase their interest rates as well.

I grew up in China and am a Chinese American. This article distorts and exaggerates too much. I myself is mostly Han but also part Manchu and part Mongolian. In my growing up, I have always had a few ethnic minorities in my class, mostly Hui Muslim, Manchu and Korean, because where I grew up. The Hui Muslims always have a separate dining hall because of their religious requirement of diet. All of them have extra scores automatically added to their real scores for the national college entrance exam, a direct and transparent affirmative action. Even during the \"one child\" era, non-Han minorities can have more children. I have a cousin who married a Hui, whose family I ended up knowing very well. My father's best friend from college is a Hui, whose daughter went to school with me and is my best friend. The government does deliberately display an image of ethnic harmony. But it does not tell the people that Han is everything. Every brain wash I received in my childhood is the contrary. Overseas Chinese community historically supported China's effort of revolution and aggression resistance. In the case of Singapore, the Chinese community drew very brutal retaliation during the Japanese occupation. But that does not mean Chinese government tries to turn ethnic Chinese overseas into its spies. There are human rights abuses in Tibet, not doubt. But the government brooms a whole bunch of Tibetan cadres to do the job, too, including human rights abuse jobs. The point is it is not \"Han is Chinese\". The article said that many people define Chinese as Han. Well, frankly that is way it is defined in countries other than China, especially among sinologists. I was really surprised to learn that when I came to the US in the 1980's and started reading books in the US about China.  I do not know what the author is trying to tell people.

Indigenous people are of course excluded as ever and again looking at supposedly Hispanic people, a very large part of that group has indigenous roots in the continent itself if not within modern political boundaries. Afro-Americans are largely the descendants of slaves, many of the 'Celtic' people were little better having been cleared from their lands in Ireland and Scotland and transported there and many of them either made bonded labourers and a few even slaves, so not really eligible for anything that would define them as potential nationalists because they retain a strong identity with their origins.

With democracy and people's power, the nationalism has chance to take control political process.\nSo blame it on socialism and democracy since working class never benefit too much directly from globalization, tech advance, automation, ect.

Thus, Arch\u00e6opteryx is assumed to be a transitional form that branched off from its dinosaur ancestors and started to fly for the first time. This imaginary tale appears in almost all evolutionist publications.\n\nEvolutionists pronounce the name of one single creature in response. This is the fossil of a bird called Arch\u00e6opteryx, one of the most widely-known so-called transitional forms among the very few that evolutionists still defend.\n\nrch\u00e6opteryx, the so-called ancestor of present-day birds according to evolutionists, lived approximately 150 million years ago. The theory holds that some small dinosaurs, such as Velociraptors or Dromeosaurs, evolved by acquiring wings and then starting to fly. Thus, Arch\u00e6opteryx is assumed to be a transitional form that branched off from its dinosaur ancestors and started to fly for the first time.\n\nHowever, the latest studies of Arch\u00e6opteryx fossils indicate that this creature is absolutely not a transitional form, but an extinct species of bird, having some insignificant differences from present-day birds.\n\nThe thesis that Arch\u00e6opteryx was a \"half-bird\" that could not fly perfectly was popular among evolutionist circles until not long ago. The absence of a sternum (breastbone) in this creature was held up as the most important evidence that this bird could not fly properly. (The sternum is a bone found under the thorax to which the muscles required for flight are attached. In our day, this breastbone is observed in all flying and non-flying birds, and even in bats, a flying mammal which belongs to a very different family.)\n\nHowever, the seventh Arch\u00e6opteryx fossil, which was found in 1992, caused great astonishment among evolutionists. The reason was that in this recently discovered fossil, the breastbone that was long assumed by evolutionists to be missing was discovered to have existed after all. This fossil was described in Nature magazine as follows:\n\nThe recently discovered seventh specimen of the Arch\u00e6opteryx preserves a partial, rectangular sternum, long suspected but never previously documented. This attests to its strong flight muscles.47\n\nThis discovery invalidated the mainstay of the claims that Arch\u00e6opteryx was a half-bird that could not fly properly.\n\nMoreover, the structure of the bird's feathers became one of the most important pieces of evidence confirming that Arch\u00e6opteryx was a flying bird in the real sense. The asymmetric feather structure of Arch\u00e6opteryx is indistinguishable from that of birds living today, and indicates that it could fly perfectly well. As the eminent paleontologist Carl O. Dunbar states, \"because of its feathers [Arch\u00e6opteryx is] distinctly to be classed as a bird.\" 48\n\nAnother fact that was revealed by the structure of Arch\u00e6opteryx's feathers was its warm-blooded metabolism. As was discussed above, reptiles and dinosaurs are cold-blooded animals whose body heat fluctuates with the temperature of their environment, rather than being homeostatically regulated. A very important function of the feathers on birds is the maintenance of a constant body temperature. The fact that Arch\u00e6opteryx had feathers showed that it was a real, warm-blooded bird that needed to regulate its body heat, in contrast to dinosaurs.\n.............SOURCE.....................You can read Harun Yahya's book The Evolution Deceit online, share it on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, download it to your computer, use it in your homework and theses, and publish, copy or reproduce it on your own web sites or blogs without paying any copyright fee, so long as you acknowledge this site as the reference."}, {"from": {"name": "Ariff Setiawann", "id": "1873646776192072"}, "created_time": "2016-11-20T08:41:02+0000", "id": "10154791943474060_10154791949454060", "message": "<3 YES!!

However, unemployment figures are low in the US and there is talk of a shortage of labor in e.g. the construction sector. This points to wage increase and thus price level rises in the near to mid future. All of this does not pose immediate threats to inflation but the Fed most likely will start to slowly abandon its low interest rate policy to keep inflation expectations in check. Higher interest rates are also necessary to attract foreign investors and borrowers to the US in order to finance Mr Trump's infrastructure spending. So in the medium term I would assume a spike in interest rates and also in inflation (from a rather low base right now). This would also put upward pressure on the US Dollar which already can be seen. If Mr Trump is, in addition to that, pursuing a more protectionist trade policy, then both domestic prices as well as currency value of the US Dollar vis-a-vis the Euro and the Renminbi will increase. US i.e. the US loses competitiveness. Americans will also find that credit financing for e.g. houses will become more expensive. This will then act as a break on consumption and work against the demand impulse from government spending. In the longer term, both effects might cancel each other out and the US economy will have higher price levels but not necessarily more employment. Regardless of that, the competitive position as regards the US Dollar will be weaker unless the ECB and other central banks start to increase their interest rates as well.

I grew up in China and am a Chinese American. This article distorts and exaggerates too much. I myself is mostly Han but also part Manchu and part Mongolian. In my growing up, I have always had a few ethnic minorities in my class, mostly Hui Muslim, Manchu and Korean, because where I grew up. The Hui Muslims always have a separate dining hall because of their religious requirement of diet. All of them have extra scores automatically added to their real scores for the national college entrance exam, a direct and transparent affirmative action. Even during the \"one child\" era, non-Han minorities can have more children. I have a cousin who married a Hui, whose family I ended up knowing very well. My father's best friend from college is a Hui, whose daughter went to school with me and is my best friend. The government does deliberately display an image of ethnic harmony. But it does not tell the people that Han is everything. Every brain wash I received in my childhood is the contrary. Overseas Chinese community historically supported China's effort of revolution and aggression resistance. In the case of Singapore, the Chinese community drew very brutal retaliation during the Japanese occupation. But that does not mean Chinese government tries to turn ethnic Chinese overseas into its spies. There are human rights abuses in Tibet, not doubt. But the government brooms a whole bunch of Tibetan cadres to do the job, too, including human rights abuse jobs. The point is it is not \"Han is Chinese\". The article said that many people define Chinese as Han. Well, frankly that is way it is defined in countries other than China, especially among sinologists. I was really surprised to learn that when I came to the US in the 1980's and started reading books in the US about China.  I do not know what the author is trying to tell people.

Indigenous people are of course excluded as ever and again looking at supposedly Hispanic people, a very large part of that group has indigenous roots in the continent itself if not within modern political boundaries. Afro-Americans are largely the descendants of slaves, many of the 'Celtic' people were little better having been cleared from their lands in Ireland and Scotland and transported there and many of them either made bonded labourers and a few even slaves, so not really eligible for anything that would define them as potential nationalists because they retain a strong identity with their origins.

With democracy and people's power, the nationalism has chance to take control political process.\nSo blame it on socialism and democracy since working class never benefit too much directly from globalization, tech advance, automation, ect.
