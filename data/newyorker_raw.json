Millions of Mexican citizens know this and millions more are willing to risk their lives and those of their children to leave this godforsaken country.  It is controlled by drug cartels, human traffickers, Hispanic Pimps, and land grabbers which are all sanctioned and protected by a failed Democratic government that does nothing for it's citizens.\n\nThis is a country with no infrastructure, no jobs for it's people, no real economy,  It is a beggar country and it's citizens are so humiliated by it's failure to take the necessary steps to improve the lives of it's citizens that they simply give up and leave.  \n\nThe Mexican flag is a disgrace.  It represents a country of a lost people.  Mexican citizens would rather risk their lives to come to America and live in a land as servants then to remain in the country of their history.

I'm not sure where you draw the line. Marc Maron was apparently big enough to get the president on and apparently get him to say the N-Word.

It think it's very tropeish and kind of dastardly in it's approach. And I think a lot of it is the \"Echo Chamber\" that a lot of people in the realm of Legitimate Political Journalism would deam counterproductive. A lot of the times they're willing to make exaggerated hyperbolic claims that carry more weight than a lof of conventional journalists can't achieve. Apparently that's bad but you have to admit or at least recognize, right now more than ever, there's a populist movement that would be gained from trying to appeal to these people's sensibilities. Bill Maher has a very openly sometimes \"intolerant\" view and trust me this is the same core Liberal Demographic that has a tendency to parade in it's own pretentiousness, avoid pretenses of classism and anti-populist lay rhetoric and there is usually a pompous demeanor there. What makes you think this entire Liberal demographic, which I even find just as deplorable as many of the \"deplorables\" named by Hillary, are going away? And what makes you think these guys haven't monopolized much of our Entertainment Industry. I hope they shape up. They've been a complete disconnect to me for years. Aside from Bill Maher, Citizen Radio with Jamie Kilstein and Alison Kilkenny. I think there's a whole revamp that would useful. No minority as well-read as I am wants to hear white guys talking about how intolerant the Republican Party is while they revel in their insulated peer groups and claim to be advocates for anyone but their own coddled selves. It's become a pretty disparaging look. And best believe it trickles into many aspects of Nerd Culture and supports a whole sleui of Journalistic Culture. \n\nI will say though that despite their monopoly on Liberal culture as a \"Subculture\" that they really do dominate pretty well in I don't mind hearing some disparaging remarks that harshly condemn a lot of Republican thought without remorse.

It is wonderful to see this in action. In contrast to these 'free range' parents who want everyone to give up parental responsibility to increase their chances that their unsupervised child wont become the target of very real predators by overstating the value of 'independence' and by using stats to equate the improbability of attacks with safety. The chances of stranger abduction are slim. Stats tell us that they are more likely to be harmed by an acquaintance. But two considerations: an unsupervised child, especially one with a repeating schedule, has a greater chance of becoming a target and the consequences are life changing if they survive even it and 2. Unsupervised children will also be more vulnerable to these more statistically likely acquaintances as well. You don't have to let parents bully you into creating 'herd immunity' for their lazy parenting - that is only reasonable against microscopic threats.

Both sides have claimed inaccurate information from media. We should point out mistakes but I think it's interesting to hear the definitions of what constitutes a \"valid\" source. I know some sources are fake and serve no purpose, but how many are just lesser known? How many are quiet voices of dissension with valid messages that just don't have our respect yet? How many can be compared to the random leaflets produced by independent people who used to stand on the street because no one would publish their radical ideas, who are not journalists, but who are trying to get the word out? Remember William Randolph Hearst? The media tycoon who \"invented\" a war so he could sell newspapers? For profit media is not here to protect the public. We have legal precedent that allows the media to report false information. Whether it's a FB feed or a string of shows on TV, it's a good thing that we have the ability to choose what we watch and read.

Everything he does, is deeply influenced by his leftist ideology and his blind devotion to Islam. However, the situation has become much worse, after the humiliating democrat defeat in the 2014 elections. Since then, Obama's actions have been clearly motivated by a profound desire of vengeance against all Republicans, and Tea Party supporters.\n\nObama's defiant tone (\"I got a pen and a phone\"), and his extensive use of executive orders to bypass Congress, are the symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder (megalomania). Indeed, he seems totally incapable of accepting that the US Constitution supersedes his executive orders...\n\nI am not particularly surprised by Obama's poor performance and defiant behaviour. As a matter of fact, this is exactly what I expected from a leftist community organizer from Chicago. How on earth such a man would ever be capable of performing the duties of POTUS?\n\nNevertheless, when it comes to the issue of race, his willingness to constantly reopening old wounds, and his sadistic desire to play blacks against whites, are truly sickening!

Millions of Mexican citizens know this and millions more are willing to risk their lives and those of their children to leave this godforsaken country.  It is controlled by drug cartels, human traffickers, Hispanic Pimps, and land grabbers which are all sanctioned and protected by a failed Democratic government that does nothing for it's citizens.\n\nThis is a country with no infrastructure, no jobs for it's people, no real economy,  It is a beggar country and it's citizens are so humiliated by it's failure to take the necessary steps to improve the lives of it's citizens that they simply give up and leave.  \n\nThe Mexican flag is a disgrace.  It represents a country of a lost people.  Mexican citizens would rather risk their lives to come to America and live in a land as servants then to remain in the country of their history.

I'm not sure where you draw the line. Marc Maron was apparently big enough to get the president on and apparently get him to say the N-Word.

It think it's very tropeish and kind of dastardly in it's approach. And I think a lot of it is the \"Echo Chamber\" that a lot of people in the realm of Legitimate Political Journalism would deam counterproductive. A lot of the times they're willing to make exaggerated hyperbolic claims that carry more weight than a lof of conventional journalists can't achieve. Apparently that's bad but you have to admit or at least recognize, right now more than ever, there's a populist movement that would be gained from trying to appeal to these people's sensibilities. Bill Maher has a very openly sometimes \"intolerant\" view and trust me this is the same core Liberal Demographic that has a tendency to parade in it's own pretentiousness, avoid pretenses of classism and anti-populist lay rhetoric and there is usually a pompous demeanor there. What makes you think this entire Liberal demographic, which I even find just as deplorable as many of the \"deplorables\" named by Hillary, are going away? And what makes you think these guys haven't monopolized much of our Entertainment Industry. I hope they shape up. They've been a complete disconnect to me for years. Aside from Bill Maher, Citizen Radio with Jamie Kilstein and Alison Kilkenny. I think there's a whole revamp that would useful. No minority as well-read as I am wants to hear white guys talking about how intolerant the Republican Party is while they revel in their insulated peer groups and claim to be advocates for anyone but their own coddled selves. It's become a pretty disparaging look. And best believe it trickles into many aspects of Nerd Culture and supports a whole sleui of Journalistic Culture. \n\nI will say though that despite their monopoly on Liberal culture as a \"Subculture\" that they really do dominate pretty well in I don't mind hearing some disparaging remarks that harshly condemn a lot of Republican thought without remorse.

It is wonderful to see this in action. In contrast to these 'free range' parents who want everyone to give up parental responsibility to increase their chances that their unsupervised child wont become the target of very real predators by overstating the value of 'independence' and by using stats to equate the improbability of attacks with safety. The chances of stranger abduction are slim. Stats tell us that they are more likely to be harmed by an acquaintance. But two considerations: an unsupervised child, especially one with a repeating schedule, has a greater chance of becoming a target and the consequences are life changing if they survive even it and 2. Unsupervised children will also be more vulnerable to these more statistically likely acquaintances as well. You don't have to let parents bully you into creating 'herd immunity' for their lazy parenting - that is only reasonable against microscopic threats.

Both sides have claimed inaccurate information from media. We should point out mistakes but I think it's interesting to hear the definitions of what constitutes a \"valid\" source. I know some sources are fake and serve no purpose, but how many are just lesser known? How many are quiet voices of dissension with valid messages that just don't have our respect yet? How many can be compared to the random leaflets produced by independent people who used to stand on the street because no one would publish their radical ideas, who are not journalists, but who are trying to get the word out? Remember William Randolph Hearst? The media tycoon who \"invented\" a war so he could sell newspapers? For profit media is not here to protect the public. We have legal precedent that allows the media to report false information. Whether it's a FB feed or a string of shows on TV, it's a good thing that we have the ability to choose what we watch and read.

Everything he does, is deeply influenced by his leftist ideology and his blind devotion to Islam. However, the situation has become much worse, after the humiliating democrat defeat in the 2014 elections. Since then, Obama's actions have been clearly motivated by a profound desire of vengeance against all Republicans, and Tea Party supporters.\n\nObama's defiant tone (\"I got a pen and a phone\"), and his extensive use of executive orders to bypass Congress, are the symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder (megalomania). Indeed, he seems totally incapable of accepting that the US Constitution supersedes his executive orders...\n\nI am not particularly surprised by Obama's poor performance and defiant behaviour. As a matter of fact, this is exactly what I expected from a leftist community organizer from Chicago. How on earth such a man would ever be capable of performing the duties of POTUS?\n\nNevertheless, when it comes to the issue of race, his willingness to constantly reopening old wounds, and his sadistic desire to play blacks against whites, are truly sickening!
