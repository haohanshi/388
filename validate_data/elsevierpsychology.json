Sure, we don't have the answers to the phenomenon we know as consciousness, but believing that the soul exists remains invalid. To the best of our knowledge, it is an illusion. If you consider the sheer complexity of the human brain, where the variety of brain states are near enough infinite (at least from a human perspective) I find that that is enough to explain why we feel so unique. If I remove your Amygdala, it will be impossible for you to control emotions. If I damage your prefrontal cortex, you will be incapable of inhibiting behaviour. When the physical state of your brain (influenced by genetics and learnt behaviour),and the external environment at that time directly transfers to your behaviour, there is NO requirement for a soul or any other spiritual form to explain personality and behaviour. Saying \"I feel or see spirits\" is ignoring the research showing that our perceptual system is our brain's best guess as to what is in the physical environment and that our brains can be persuaded in a number of ways without there being a shred of measured evidence.
