Many things they were taught as young adults have either been disproven or changed. They don't understand how that works & it confuses & frightens them as well as making them suspicious of facts. ALL facts. So they go to the one thing that hasn't changed. Religion. Many don't understand how the lobby system or most of the branches of government work.
