I know its a pain to do it, but you should go back and check what the correct answer was to every question you got wrong and try to see why you got it wrong. For the writing section, make up whatever information you want for the essay, they do not check for accuracy. As for the multiple choice writing questions, make sure you are aware of the most common grammar concepts that are tested. For example, \"Every student in the class failed their test\" is WRONG. And if you don't know that, you will get questions wrong. For math, make sure you do the problems that you know how to do first. Then, go back and do the problems that are harder.
