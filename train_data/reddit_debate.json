Saying \"put that in the top 5\" and getting with a \"group of debaters\" suggests a method of agenda-setting that might not let everyone have a say, which isn't cool since civics is a huge part of this event; denying some competitors a fair way to set the agenda undermines civics.

Don't be afraid to role play in your speeches; in fact, I encourage you to do so. Legislation may well have an impact on your constituents, and you can totally use negative impacts on constituents as a mechanism for negating certain legislation, or positive impacts on constituents as reasoning for affirming that legislation.", "Legislation takes the form of bills, resolutions, and Constitutional Amendments. Bills have the force of law, resolutions are statements of position the author feels Congress should take (and therefore do not have the force of law), and Constitutional Amendments are self-explanatory. Assuming people mainly write bills, you could use specifics of the bill as support for either side of a speech (usually the negative; example: the bill needs funding for its execution, but doesn't list a funding mechanism or is flawed in how it allocates funding; this could be used in a negative attack, followed by establishing that affirmative impacts are nonexistent if the bill can't be executed due to lack of funds).", "You can prepare speech outlines (don't write speeches word for word, even if you're new to this; I'll explain that more in a bit), but if you're busy with other stuff as well, you may not have as much time to do all speeches before the tournament. This is where your prep comes in, as you should be taking it to the tournament with you anyway; if you find you need to come up with a speech in the middle of the tournament, you have your research to help out, along with material from the other side of the debate to refute if you're still on that topic.", "When you gather your research and get to writing your speeches, don't do them word for word, even if you're writing an authorship speech. Congress speeches are meant to be extemporaneous; reading a word for word manuscript is completely against the point. Scripts tend to be inflexible, so if you aren't the first affirmative speaker, you may find it harder to include refutation of arguments on the opposing side. Also, if you rely too much on reading the speech, your eye contact in particular will suffer for it. This isn't to say you can't glance at notes (you should totally look at the evidence you're citing, for example), but more often than not, you should have your eyes up.", "A basic speech outline may have some material for an intro, along with taglines for your arguments, evidence to support those arguments written down (always make sure to have the full evidence on hand somewhere in case it becomes an issue), and some material for a conclusion. Things like transitions, analysis of evidence, and impacts should all either be kept off of the pad, or at least not written word for word. If having certain keywords helps for any of those, then feel free to jot them down, but aim to deliver them extemporaneously. When you are transitioning between points, when you are explaining why your arguments matter, when you are explaining why an opponent's argument is insufficient, it helps to make a connection with your peers. Looking at them instead of looking down at your paper strengthens that connection and displays a sharper delivery.", "A final note on arguments: an effective structure I alluded to above is claim, warrant, impact. In this context, your claim is the argument or point you're trying to make, your warrant is whatever evidence or logic supports that argument or point, and your impact explains why what you're saying matters. Without some sort of warrant, claims become unwarranted assertions, which hold little weight, especially against a point that does have a warrant. Without an impact, people don't have a reason to seriously consider your argument as significant. Don't assume that your evidence speaks for itself; take the time to analyze and establish significance in your own words, as this is your speech, not that of the scholar from the source you cited. Keep all this in mind when you're formulating arguments.", "About delivery, I've explained why eye contact is important, but another big thing for me is at least projecting confidence. That doesn't mean \"use a booming voice\" or anything like that. Fluidity of speech is confidence; stumbling, overuse of filler words, or other controllable vocal tics betray nervousness. Consistent eye contact across the room is confidence; relying on the legal pad or staring into space betrays a lack of preparation. Firm positioning, as opposed to pacing around the room aimlessly (you should walk with purpose, like to assist a transition) or swaying from side to side all the time, is confidence. ", "Even if you're not actually confident, doing these things makes you look confident. This isn't to say that a silver tongue or excellent body control are substitutes for content and argumentation; even if you deliver a crisp, confident speech, a lack of substantive content still hurts. Rather, good use of your body and your voice complements good content and forms the whole, which is to say good argumentation/analysis/clash + good delivery = great speech.", "Finally, I'll touch on questioning. If you want to question a speaker, you stand when the Presiding Officer (the student up front with the gavel running the show, to whom I'll refer as the PO) calls for questioners to rise. You do not speak until you are granted permission by the PO; they'll say something like \"Representative Carsontheninja\", you'll ask your question, and the speaker will answer it. Do not ask questions just to ask questions; make sure they have a purpose. To this point, do not ask soft or friendly questions, even if you're on the same side as that speaker. Tough, incisive questions about the content of their speech are what make for good questioning; this advances good debate much more effectively than something like \"Do you agree that blahblahblah?\" ", "Once the question has been answered, you may take your seat unless you have another question you wish to ask. You do not get two-part questions in Congressional Debate (unless a suspension of the rules to allow a two-part question is passed, which will basically never happen, so don't try it). Unless your tournament runs using a Direct Questioning format, you will not have uninterrupted back and forth crossfire with the speaker. Keep that in mind so that you don't make the mistake of speaking out of turn during the questioning period.", "Hopefully all of this helps. Again, be sure to look through the whole guide I linked you near the top; it covers much of what I've talked about here and more. Good luck at your tournament!", "Inevitably, there will be at least one bill that might be pretty one-sided, where most people want to be Pro/Con. Write a draft for the position that you think most students will oppose", "This is useful for two reasons.", "1) Statistically, you get to speak more often, increasing your overall score and likelihood of ranking.", "2) You learn to think about issues through a more critical and unbiased lens, which helps in all debate events.", "With that being said, if you didn't properly prepare, you're going to get grilled in Cross-Examination.", "EDIT: Also make sure you research and have questions for every bill being considered.

To quote the relevant part: ", "Activity - PO selects speakers based [on] whom they have already recognized for questions and motions. The problem with this is that the PO could still be biased in recognizing legislators for questions and motions in the first place, and it encourages impertinent questions, just for the sake of being recognized.", "So while you're correct in encouraging OP to be prepared, if your tournaments' PO's choose speakers based on activity, I would encourage them to stop since it's an unfair mechanism that isn't necessarily conducive to quality participation.", "Yeah, that's the thing, though.

One extemper event went the lengths to amend Stern's Wikipedia page to read: \"She is regularly cited by Speech and Debate Students for her wide knowledge on Foreign Policy, the Environment, Space, Haitian Elections, Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign, and financial markets.\" Upon closer inspection, and considering the fact she is an expert on terrorism, there is no article by her about the TPP. She also cites the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which has never published an article about the specific focus on the TPP and the effect on women. Her speech is rife with factual errors. Singaporean tax benefits seem to not exist, nor do Shinzo Abe's plan to install more renewable energy(instead he has pivoted to nuclear energy.) I find it extremely disturbing that this type of academic dishonesty seems rampant and premeditated across her speech. I, along with many others, can attest that she uses the same fake experts in many extemp rounds. This blatant misconstruing and creation of fact has finally been recorded. While it is too late to allow another deserving extemper to take her spot on the stage, it is not too late to punish her for her lying and dishonesty. Going through the recording of the speech, it is obvious that this is a destruction of what the NSDA has tried to work towards for the past 50 years. Please heed my concerns.", "I followed up on September 9 and September 21 and none of my emails garnered even a response. Anyone can watch her speech and Google her sources to find nothing. I understand making mistakes in citations on a national stage, but citing experts that don't exist, from tournament to tournament, isn't a mistake. It's simple academic dishonesty and needs to be punished. The NSDA's silence about this is deafening. I do not want to start a witchunt, which is why I left the name out. But I do not know what else to do.", "How do you think they should be punished?", "When an interper miscuts a piece, their name literally gets deleted off the official results. Look how HI only has 5 people in the final round because a kid got DQed. I sent this message well ahead of the official results. If they truly cared about integrity, they would've taken the same action. I think revoking victories is fair. I also think that the NSDA has to make sure this doesn't happen again. I know many who would've loved to be on that stage but were disadvantaged because they wouldn't create their own sources. It's a real travesty to the seventh place individual, and the NSDA has to think long and hard about what they're going to do to prevent this in the future aka source checks in semis and finals before publishing results.", "That's a solution I can get behind.

For example, if I have a card from John Smith saying the IoT increases automation by 50% (not an actual thing I'm making it up), and I get an extemp topic about labor automation, am I allowed to reference John Smith in my speech provided that I don't read the card during prep time?", "Certain tournaments do fact check.

There are issues that plague this nation; regardless of your beliefs on what the solution should be, these issues require them.  With a president, who essentially has dismissed any formal code of behavior and conduct, we cannot be certain that congress will be willing to work with him.  Granted, in our ever-polarizing world, this possibility exists for both candidates but it is one that acutely affects Trump. His lack of decorum also threatens our international relations, many of which hang on tentative balances constructed over years of diplomacy.

Trump has been cautioned, by leaders of his own party, former presidents, and respected political strategists that his policies are dangerous.  Clinton's notion of establishing a no-fly zone is incredibly preferable to the ambiguous notion of 'bombing the hell out of isis,' 'torturing [terrorist's] families,' which I remind you is a war crime, and engaging in full scale US military operations to establish 'US power in the region.'  On top of this, Trump's domestic policies of expelling illegal immigrants, banning immigration for certain ethnicities and religions, and his use of xenophobic, angry, and racist rhetoric is incredibly dangerous for our nation.

Make excuses about the uneducated turning out for him, about the third parties, whatever you say, what he has done is just objectively impressive. While I don't think he alone will be able to make decisions that will change our country for the better alone, I know he will try to surround himself with the best minds the right has to offer. At the end of the day, he just wants what is best for America, he just has a different plan.", "framework and T will become a lot weaker.", "most neg impacts are probably non-unique now.", "Everyone hide in your nuclear cellars, America's gone to shit", "Could be worse.

So much for being civil. ", "Someone that would comment NOOOOOOOOOO would get the same amount of downvotes. Its not about what he believes, but the quality of the post.", "Lets be real, this comment got shit on because of the liberal biases that exist in the debate community, not because it was a comment of \"poor quality\".", "Er, I doubt that, at least currently. I've seen comments which are basically the same get 80-100 upvotes today.", "No impact and no link. The downvotes are deserved on grounds of laziness. "]
