Also Romani raised taxes trying desperately to stay within the 3% limit in deficit imposed by the EU. Needless to say the second time he ran against Berlusconi he lost. Berlusconi term came to an end not because he had lost confidence in the parliament but because he was forced out by the EU and Merkel via the Italian president Napolitano who chose Monti as the prime minister.
