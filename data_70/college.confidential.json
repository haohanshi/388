Is that ok?", "Yeah, I thought someone called?", "I thought the running problem is one of the multiple choices?now I think I had 12.5 as well. My memory messed up", "Experimental was math for me. I had 2 sections of 25 MC so yeah", "I think it was unverifiable, because she said that they know it's there, they just don't know what it is", "What did you put anyways?", "it was on the other hand", "No, he's not.

Anyone know if this same thing has happened the morning scores are released?", "The reason I thought it was deceptive was because in the first passage they were only reference the \"blank slate\" line. In passage two they said that although children are not born with any knowledge, they do have an innate ability to learn language. So even though technically the child is a blank slate, they can easily pick up a language. That's why I though \"blank slate\" was deceptive and not unthinkable. Unthinkable seems like it would only be used to describe passage two if they were really attacking passage one, while from what I remember they were just stating their side. I was between unthinkable and deceptive though, so you could definitely be right.", "Both words were supposed to convey a sense of \"fussing over little details\".

Any consensus on these two questions?", "Hi guys, can people who took the SAT in December tell me what the scale was in each section? If you don't know exactly could you just tell me how many you got wrong and your final score? Thanks in advance", "hey everyone, as a tip, i would like to advice: don't contemplate on  this topic too much.

So the idea that babies have such abilities would seem unthinkable to them.", "If the suspense is killing you, you must calm down and take deep breaths.
