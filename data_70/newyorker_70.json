Everything he does, is deeply influenced by his leftist ideology and his blind devotion to Islam. However, the situation has become much worse, after the humiliating democrat defeat in the 2014 elections. Since then, Obama's actions have been clearly motivated by a profound desire of vengeance against all Republicans, and Tea Party supporters.\n\nObama's defiant tone (\"I got a pen and a phone\"), and his extensive use of executive orders to bypass Congress, are the symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder (megalomania). Indeed, he seems totally incapable of accepting that the US Constitution supersedes his executive orders...\n\nI am not particularly surprised by Obama's poor performance and defiant behaviour. As a matter of fact, this is exactly what I expected from a leftist community organizer from Chicago. How on earth such a man would ever be capable of performing the duties of POTUS?\n\nNevertheless, when it comes to the issue of race, his willingness to constantly reopening old wounds, and his sadistic desire to play blacks against whites, are truly sickening!
