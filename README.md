## How to run our code:
The main program can be run by running the main.py file in the repository. We only need one extra parameter to run the program during each step. 
First of all, we should optimize the model before we start working on the data by calling
./main.py optimize_kernel
and
./main.py optimize_params

Then, we can start generating features from the data weâ€™ve collected by calling:
./main.py generate_features

This instruction will automatically generate the features from the pages we collected.
In the end, we can test our model by calling:
./main.py test
to render the result of prediction model.
