## How to run our code:
Before starting, make sure that required packages are installed. We've put all the requirements in a txt file so that everything can be downloaded by calling the following command:
```terminal
pip install --requirements.txt
```
The main program can be run by running the main.py file in the repository. We only need one extra parameter to run the program during each step. 
First of all, we should optimize the model before we start working on the data by calling
```terminal
./main.py optimize_kernel
```
and
```terminal
./main.py optimize_params
```
Then, we can start generating features from the data weâ€™ve collected:
```terminal
./main.py generate_features
```

This instruction will automatically generate the features from the pages we collected.
In the end, we can test our model:
```terminal
./main.py test
```
to render the result of prediction model.
