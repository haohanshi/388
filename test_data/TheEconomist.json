However, unemployment figures are low in the US and there is talk of a shortage of labor in e.g. the construction sector. This points to wage increase and thus price level rises in the near to mid future. All of this does not pose immediate threats to inflation but the Fed most likely will start to slowly abandon its low interest rate policy to keep inflation expectations in check. Higher interest rates are also necessary to attract foreign investors and borrowers to the US in order to finance Mr Trump's infrastructure spending. So in the medium term I would assume a spike in interest rates and also in inflation (from a rather low base right now). This would also put upward pressure on the US Dollar which already can be seen. If Mr Trump is, in addition to that, pursuing a more protectionist trade policy, then both domestic prices as well as currency value of the US Dollar vis-a-vis the Euro and the Renminbi will increase. US i.e. the US loses competitiveness. Americans will also find that credit financing for e.g. houses will become more expensive. This will then act as a break on consumption and work against the demand impulse from government spending. In the longer term, both effects might cancel each other out and the US economy will have higher price levels but not necessarily more employment. Regardless of that, the competitive position as regards the US Dollar will be weaker unless the ECB and other central banks start to increase their interest rates as well.

I am confident many men, for example , tend to give up valuable time with their kids in order to work more hours . \n That being said , I think flexible benefits and flex days are the way of the future . Ideally , flex benefits could be used for childcare for women who are mothers, or for massage , Botox , or whatever for women who have no desire to be mothers. \n Flex days are a good way for mothers to attend child related events and take care of sick children . Alternately , women who don't want to be moms get more days to travel or take extra online schooling . This way , moms can attend to their kids properly without it being perceived as an excuse to miss work .", "Haven't read all of it but he's black, so it may have something to do with any negativity.\nHe's turned the Co around has the Kardashians in his back pocket.

Neoliberal capitalism is different to the capitalism of the Keynesian period, which is different again the the capitalism if the inter-war period, which was different again to that of the guilded age etc.\n\nIn between all of these periods there is a time of interregnum when the old consensus is swept away and a new consensus is achieved; thesis and antithesis leading to synthesis.\n\nThat has been the strength of capitalism, it's ability to adapt as necessary, but rather than behave pragmatically and and adapt since the financial crisis, neoliberal capitalism has dug in and decided that the upward redistribution of wealth is more important than the longevity of western civilisation.\n\nIn short neoliberal capitalism needs to be consigned to the dustbin of history because it is the true path to serfdom for the vast majority of people and could cause the extinction of the human race. \n\nCapitalism must adapt again or it will give way to fascism or some kind of neo-medievalism.\n\nSo it's not really capitalism that people are protesting against, it's neoliberalism, and since neoliberalism is the philosophy that dare not speak its' name, most people don't know what it's called; so they protest against capitalism.", "If the airlines didn't have to pay union wages and benefits then perhaps they wouldn't have to resort to these cost-cutting tactics.", "If everyone has enough why do we care if someone has more?", "Maybe the schools could start by teaching ethics in journalism.
